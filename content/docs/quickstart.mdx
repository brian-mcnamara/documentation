In this quickstart guide, you'll run Pomerium Core with Docker containers. Assuming you've got the prerequisites ready to go, this guide should take about 90 seconds to get up and running with Pomerium!

## Prerequisites

- A configured [identity provider]
- [Docker] and [Docker Compose]

## Configure Pomerium

Create a [configuration file] (e.g. `config.yaml`) for defining Pomerium's configuration settings, routes, and access policies.

<ConfigDocker />

:::tip **Note**

Keep track of the path to this file, relative to the `docker-compose.yaml` file created in the next step. `docker-compose.yaml` will need the correct relative path to your `config.yaml`.

:::

## Configure Docker


Copy the following `docker-compose.yaml` file and modify it to include the correct path to your `config.yaml` file:

<DockerCompose />

## Run Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

Docker will automatically download the required [container images] for Pomerium and [verify]. Then, Pomerium will run with the configuration details set in the previous steps.

You should now be able to access the routes (e.g. `https://verify.localhost.pomerium.io`) as specified in your policy file.

### Handle self-signed certificate warning

Under **(Signed Identity Token)[https://docs.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/getting-users-identity]**, you will see a list of JWT claims with your user details:

![jwt claims](./img/quickstart/jwt-claims.png)

## Next Steps

Now, you can experiment with adding services to Docker and defining routes and policies for them in Pomerium. See [Guides](/docs/guides) for help or inspiration.

:::caution

This is a test environment! If you followed all the steps in this doc your Pomerium environment is not using trusted certificates. Remember to use a valid certificate solution before moving this configuration to a production environment. See [Certificates][tls certificates] for more information.
