# What is Pomerium?

Pomerium is a zero-trust gateway that secures access to your internal and external applications. As an open-source reverse proxy, Pomerium verifies requests to any resource by enforcing your access control policies, ensuring that only the right users with the right permissions can reach the protected resource.

## Why Pomerium?

### Dynamic Access Control

Pomerium allows you to configure [Authorization Policy](/docs/capabilities/authorization) that factors in **User Identity** and **Context** to policy decisions. By verifying that a user is who they say they are and the context surrounding a user’s request satisfies your policy criteria, Pomerium can dynamically enforce access control to any endpoint, be it in the cloud or on-premises.

### Context-Aware Access and External Data Sources

Pomerium allows you to integrate [External Data Sources](/docs/integrations), which serve as additional context that you can use to inform policy decisions. For example, you could import a list of GeoIP ranges to restrict or grant access to a resource based on a user’s known IP fingerprint, or import your HR directory so that only members of the HR department can access HR data.

### JWT Verification

Pomerium supports [JWT verification](/docs/capabilities/getting-users-identity) by allowing you to forward JWT claims in a cryptographically signed **Assertion Header** to upstream applications. Pomerium generates and signs a new JWT based on the ID token provided by your identity provider; this way, you can verify **user identity** and that Pomerium signed and forwarded the JWT.

### Mutual TLS (mTLS) Authentication

Pomerium supports [client-side mTLS](/docs/capabilities/mtls-clients) and [server-side mTLS](/docs/capabilities/mtls-services). Mutual authentication ensures both the client and server have authenticated each other's identities by presenting valid certificates signed by a trusted Certificate Authority before communicating over an encrypted network — a key aspect of enforcing a zero trust security framework.

### Continuous Verification

A true zero trust architecture requires that you verify each request before access is granted to a protected resource. Pomerium holds true to this tenet by continuously evaluating policy on a [per-request basis](/docs/capabilities/authorization#continuous-verification) — even after a user has successfully authenticated and accessed a resource.

### Request Audit Logs

In addition to enforcing stringent policy checks on every request, Pomerium also provides verbose [Audit Logs](/docs/capabilities/audit-logs) that include request metadata, such as request ID, request method and time, user and session ID, email, and more.
