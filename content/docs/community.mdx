## Community Office Hours

Pomerium runs community office hours to provide Q&A to community members who are using or contributing to [Pomerium Core](https://github.com/pomerium).

### **Where**

Office hours are held in [#community-office-hours](https://pomerium-io.slack.com/archives/C05BYLZF064) in the [Pomerium Community Slack](https://slack.pomerium.io/), in conjunction with a Zoom video conference. [Sign up here](https://www.pomerium.com/pomerium-community-office-hours/).

### **When**

- 2nd Wednesday of each month at 2:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (San Francisco)

### **Guidelines and caveats**

- We welcome everyone from the community to join us to provide respectful and constructive feedback about Pomerium.
- Q&A will be conducted via putting your question into the Zoom Q&A or asked in the [#community-office-hours](https://pomerium-io.slack.com/archives/C05BYLZF064) Slack channel. Questions that are considered off-topic or inappropriate will be ignored.
- These sessions are not intended as a channel for general Pomerium support requests. Please use [#support](https://pomerium-io.slack.com/archives/CK92MUAES) for questions in that category.
- As these are unscripted office hours provided to the community, there may be times when a question is complex and will be determined as “Cannot be adequately answered immediately.” We will take note of that and do a writeup of the situation.
- The Q&A sessions will be recorded for internal use.

## Get help

For general help and configuration questions, discussions about integrations or complex setups, or anything else related to Pomerium, head to our [Discuss](https://discuss.pomerium.com/) forum, where you can search for open threads or start a new one.

We prefer to communicate in Discuss so that answers can be indexes and easy to find for others. If a specific issue requires a faster back and forth to find a resolution, we may ask to move the discussion to [our slack channel](https://slack.pomerium.io).

## Report bugs

Like every software, Pomerium has its flaws. If you find one, [search the issues](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues/new) and describe the bug, and somebody will look into it!

Please follow the issue template so we have all the needed information. We need to be able to repeat the bug using your instructions. Please simplify the issue as much as possible. The more detailed and specific you are, the faster we will be able to help you!

We suggest reading [How to Report Bugs Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

## Suggest features

First, search to see if your feature has already been requested on [GitHub](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues) or [Discuss](https://discuss.pomerium.com/). If it has, you can add a :+1: reaction to vote for it. If your feature idea is new, open an issue to request the feature. You don't have to follow the bug template for feature requests. Please describe your idea thoroughly so that we know how to implement it! Really vague requests may not be helpful or actionable and without clarification will have to be closed.

While we really do value your requests and implement many of them, not all features are a good fit for Pomerium. If a feature is not in the best interest of the Pomerium project or its users in general, we may politely decline to implement it.
